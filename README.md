# Howdy!

I’m Nazmus Saadat As-Saquib, a graduate researcher who is enthusiastic about pushing the boundaries of brain-inspired computing. My previous experiences with semiconductor materials and device fabrication have motivated me towards Hardware-Software Co-design. In pursuit of more efficient algorithms, I have now my focus in developing novel algorithms that mimic the sophisticated learning mechanisms of the human brain.


Beyond my research pursuits, I find joy in exploring the world and cherishing moments with my loved ones. Whether it’s traveling to new destinations or spending quality time with family and close friends, these experiences enrich my life and inspire my work.


Let’s go on an exciting journey of science, innovation, and personal fulfillment. Whether you’re here to delve into the complexities of brain-inspired algorithms, explore the future of artificial intelligence, or simply partake in the joy of scientific inquiry and life’s adventures, I’m delighted to welcome you on this transforming trip.
